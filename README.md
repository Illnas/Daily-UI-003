Daily UI 003 

This challenge was to create a landing page. Since I usually have hard time finding ideas for projects, I decided to make a
my own "brand", which would be Animal Kingdom. What is "Animal Kingdom" going to entail, as of now, I am not sure.
But I do know that it makes things a lot easier, since I will recycle most of the images used, and since they are images
from unsplash.com I will have easier time crediting owners (or creators, if you like it) of those images I am using.


Anyway, I was finally playing more with keyframes. Still, I need more of playtime with them so I will see what next assignment
is. 

See ya there!
